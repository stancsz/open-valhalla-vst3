## Rules

1.  **Screenshot Updates**: Before committing changes that affect the UI, ensure the plugin screenshot is updated.
2.  **Single Screenshot**: Ensure only one screenshot file exists in the repository (e.g., `screenshot.png`). Remove any duplicates (e.g., `screenshot_000.png`). Always keep the newer screenshot, not the older one.
